Vdesk README

Vdesk is derived from Idesk and was written by MrChuoi <mrchuoi@yahoo.com>
- The basic idea and alot of drawing code and database structures are come
  from Idesk (written by Chris Roberts <nikon at sc dot rr dot com> -
              http://dramamine.darktech.org/~nikon, ICQ: 63345004)
- The idea of timer control is come from fluxbox (fluxbox.sf.net)

* INSTALL
 $ make
 $ su
 # cp idesk /usr/local/bin/vdesk

* USAGE
When starting at the first time, Vdesk will create $HOME/.vdesk &
$HOME/.vdesk/config. If you're using Idesk (Idesk-0.3.5 with my patch)
you can simply rename $HOME/.idesktop to $HOME/.vdesk or just make a
soft link as follow:
  $ cd $HOME
  $ ln -s .idesktop .vdesk

and then start Vdesk

The content of $HOME/.vdesk/config looks like this:

table Config
  FontName: tahoma
  FontSize: 8
  FontColor: #ffffff
  PaddingX: 35
  PaddingY: 25
  Locked: false
  HighContrast: false
  Transparency: 150
  Shadow: true
  ShadowColor: #000000
  ShadowX: 1
  ShadowY: 2
  Bold: false
  SingleClick: false
  IconPath: /path/to/icon/folder1:/path/to/icon/folder2:...
  Background.Source: ~/.vdesk/backgrounds
  Background.Delay: 3
  Background.Mode: Stretch
end

"Locked" is boolean (true/false). "Transparency" is between 0 (no glow
effect) and 255 (invisible without a mouseover).

"HighContrast" will draw a border around the text in the opposite colour
if it is true.  It will draw it in an arbitary colour if it "#aa00aa",
for example.  And it will not draw anything at all if it is set to "false".

"Shadow" is boolean (true/false). Turning this on will draw a drop shadow
of color ShadowColor behind the text. The shadow will be ShadowX pixels
right and ShadowY pixels down (negative values will work). Both ShadowX
and ShadowY default to 1.

"Bold" is a boolean (true/false). Setting it to true will make your font bold.

"SingleClick" is a boolean (true/false). Setting it to true will allow you
activate application with one mouse click (default is double click).

"IconPath" is the path which you want vdesk to search for an icon when the icon
doesn't have the path (See below)

"Background.Source" is a path to an image of a folder containing some images
"Background.Delay" number of minutes the background will change to new one
"Background.Mode" display mode of an image on the background (Stretch, Tile
or Center)

Unlike Idesk, to add an icon, you just activate Vdesk's popup menu (by holding
down Ctrl key and press Right mouse button on desktop), and choose "Create
link" item. A dialog box will show up, and you can input the information for
a new link.

The content of a link looks like this:

table Icon
  Caption: Home
  Command: nautilus /home/you
  Icon: ~/.vdesk/icons/home.png
end

If you want to have multi-line icon text, use ";" as separator for lines:

table Icon
  Caption: Very long;text;string
  Command: abc
  Icon: abc.png
end

* NOTE: an icon without path will be searched in order: ~/.vdesk/icons,
~/.vdesk, and all paths in IconPath field of Config table

You can create a link for device as follow:

table Icon
  Caption: cdrom
  Command: nautilus /mnt/cdrom
  Device: /dev/cdrom
  Folder: /mnt/cdrom
  Mount: mount -oro
  Umount: umount
  Icon: cdrom_off.png
  ActiveIcon: cdrom_on.png
end

This kind of link can apply to smb, nfs, loop file, ... also!

Other options are the same as Idesk
