* Things to do to get vdesk running with Debian:

- Create /etc/X11/Xsession.d/100xfree86-local-vdesk with:

/usr/local/bin/vdesk &

chmod +x 100xfree86-local-vdesk

- Launch blackbox from /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc:

blackbox


* Upgrade Debian sid from 2.4.18 to 2.6.0-test2, background cannot
display. Icons displays ok. Quick fix:

delay 1sec before launching vdesk:

/etc/X11/Xsession.d/100xfree86-local-vdesk:

sleep 1 && /usr/local/bin/vdesk &
